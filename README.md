# HavradX_Learning_Python

This repository is an overview of the work done to complete HarvardX's "CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python". This is the first step towards the Professional Certificate : Learning Python for Data Science that I obtained in November 2024.

The folder "0_First_Time"  is composed of the codes I wrote when I was frist learning Python.

The Problem Sets "PBsets#" in the main folder are the same as in "0_First_Time", but wrote more recently, after having gained some experience programming.
